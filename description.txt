[center][b][u][size=6]Mod Features:[/size][/u][/b][/center]
Apologizing to Halsin for coming on too strong is only available if you actually flirted with him at the Tiefling Party.
When asked what Halsin wants at the end of Act 2, he will not tell you what he wants is a who. (The option that leads to that and the horny duergar option has been removed).
In Act 3, if you meet the requirements to unlock his camp night conversation, he will not confess to you. You will instead always get the platonic version of this scene.

[size=5][b][u]Compatibility:[/u][/b][/size]
Compatible with all my other mods!

Not good for multiplayer runs where someone may want to romance Halsin. This mod locks everyone out. Sorry.
