In order to get Halsin's Act 3 Camp Night you need do one of the following:
Have a conversation with Halsin at the tiefling party
Flirt with Halsin in any act and don't take it back
Learn about his age - (if you've exhausted all the options to learn more about him, you're good here)

By default, you will get the platonic version.

If you have 20+ approval and have flirted with Halsin, you will unlock the romantic version of his Act 3 Camp Night.

Earning Approval
Contains spoilers: https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Halsin/Approval
But as long as you finish Halsin's Act 2 quest and are nice when you speak to [redacted] (iykyk) after, you'll have enough. I decided to lower the approval requirement because you can easily trigger his camp night before you have enough approval by accident :(

How to set Halsin's flirt flag*:

*You only need to do one of these listed below

Act 1
At the tiefling party, tell him "There's something we could do besides talking."
If you apologize for coming on too strong afterwards, do NOT tell him to "Forget it happened."

Act 1 or 2
Ask How he is doing at camp and follow one of these two paths:
1) "You're welcome" -> "Maybe you could show your appreciation another way"
Or
2) "Perhaps I could share more than a camp fire and some company..."

If you've already flirted with him in Act 1, you may not get the tree with those paths until Act 2. But as previously mentioned, you only need to flirt once in any act.

Act 2 Epilogue
If you're on the platonic path at this point because you haven't flirted yet, if you've finished Halsin's quest, you will have one last opportunity to flirt with him.
Ask him "What now?" and then say "So just friends, then?"
